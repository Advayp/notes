## Customer Obsession
- Customer Feedback
	- Skyline Notes - adjusting/adding functionality based on feedback from students
- Prioritizing Different Customer Needs
	- Flexibility in terms of how the product is used
	- Skyline Notes - variety of use cases, up to user to decide how to use information
- Difficult Client/Not meeting expectations
	- Skyline Notes - manager wanted certain functionality to be implemented that was really just fluff (extensive messaging, administrative systems)
		- Reminded of original aim, with an emphasis on flexiblity

## Ownership
- Showing ownership/Going above and beyond/Driving factor
	- Math game for Radiance
- Unclear responsibilities/Bigger opportunity than manager
	- Math game
- Missed deadlines/Unfinished
	- Math game
- Peer struggling
	- Math help for friend
	- S: Struggling in math class, teacher wasn't helping properly
	- T: Help get friend up to speed
	- A: Regular tutoring
	- R: Improved grade for friend, improved understanding of math for me, found joy in teaching

## Invent and Simplify
- Simplifying life for customers/Most innovative
	- SnapCook
- Solving a problem
	- SnapCook
- Challenging problem where usual approach didn't work
	- SnapCook
- Changing the view of a particular department
	- SnapCook

## Are Right, A Lot
- Significant Failure/When I was wrong
	- Math game - misinterpreted what kind of games kids like
	- Initial efficacy of my games was extremely poor, and in the moment it was just a waste of time
	- Learning exp: get to know market better, don't assume
- Conflict Questions
	- Disagreements with Youssef over Skyline Notes
- Judgement Call Questions
	- Data: Skyline Notes
	- Little to no Data: Math game/Vyn
- Ambiguity
	- Math game - deciding on using CS and making a game in the first place

## Learn and Be Curious
- Active learning/Keeping up with industry trends
	- Hackathons
	- 1% better every day - continuously pushing myself
	- SnapCook
- Learning something new/Getting uncomfortable/Deeper level of understanding/Challenging status quo
- Losing fresh perspective
	- Math game - lack of openness caused initial failure
- Counterintuitive solution
	- SnapCook - taking advantage of opportunity to create a unique solution to a problem that, historically, has only been solved in one way
- Recent book
	- Can't hurt me

## Hire and Develop the Best


## Insist on the Highest Standards
- Ensuring high standards
	- SnapCook - voice command system
- Continuous improve/doing better on a goal
	- Gym - Eating properly and doing more research
- Improving an already good service
	- Math game - kids' performance was already good
	- But, I felt that school should create lifelong learners and emphasize passion for learning
- Refusing to compromise standards
	- Skyline notes - manager wanted additional features, though I felt they only made the application more confusing and less flexible
- Not meeting expectations
	- SnapCook - wanted to do more with object detection, couldn't integrate model 
- Long term project
	- Doom scrollers
	- Small, actionable goals, each explicitly connected to the bigger picture


## Think Big
- Risk
	- SnapCook - opting to use AR during the hackathon 
	- None of my teammates were familiar with AR or even game development at all 
	- We took the risk because we thought it'd be a great learning opportunity
- Failed Risk
	- SnapCook
	- Couldn't implement as many features as we wanted 
	- We got a lot done, but there was still a lot of functionality we wanted to add 
- Radical Approach
	- Snap Cook
- Beyond scope
	- SnapCook: initial scope was focusing on healthy eating
	- We made it also focus on accessibility and ease-of-use 
	- This would cause more people to actually eat healthy since it was now easier

## Bias for Action
- Calculated Risk/Decision with incomplete info/Tight deadlines
	- Choosing to make something with Snap AR
	- Didn't know how long it was gonna take to adjust, but had faith in my ability to learn quickly and adapt
	- Result: 2nd place, Practical Application
- Moving forward or gathering more information
	- Skyline Notes
	- Had some information about students' needs
	- Didn't get more because effective quick service was the main goal
- Not waiting for other people
	- Math game
- Getting info from someone who wasn't response
	- Skyline Notes 
	- Youssef gave little info about project
	- Focused on creating a minimalistic and flexible application to suit a variety of needs
	- This ended up being more effective as more customers were drawn to it and weren't forced to use the application in a particular way

## Frugality
- Limited time/resources
	- SnapCook - limited timeframe + terrible documentation bc product was so new


## Earn Trust
- Not meeting commitment
	- Couldn't integrate model 
	- Problem was with underlying software, found a work around but didn't work as well as we wanted to 
	- Learning: try to fix asap, adapt if necessary
- Direct feedback
	- SnapCook - divided team bc I felt that we needed more on the backend
- Big decision + justifying
	- HCP - Switching to mobile app, justified by keeping customers in mind, Adjust timeline to allow for learning

## Dive Deep
- Anything with Data
	- Skyline Notes
	- Data suggested students were stressed, but not why
	- Used key metrics relating to why they were stressed to figure out solution
- Informing policy/product with data
	- Math game 

## Backbone
- Disagreements
	- Youssef w Skyline Notes
	- HCP Mobile App
- Going with the group instead of disagreeing
	- SnapCook 
	- Group wanted a voice command system to improve accessibility
	- I was worried about performance
	- In the end, I ended up implementing it anyway to prioritize simplicity 

## Deliver Results
- Literally whatever project you want, try to focus on SnapCook
