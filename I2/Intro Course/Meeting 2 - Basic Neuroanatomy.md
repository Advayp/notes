## Neurons
- Main cell behind brain's functionality
- Main parts
	- Dendrite: long arm that connects to other neurons
	- Cell body: where signals are processed
	- Axon: where electrical signal is propagated and passed to other neurons
	- Synapse: end of axon, sends chemical signals to other neurons
- Across the cell membrane, the neuron maintains a potential difference. Signals from other neurons affect this, which can result in the opening of other gates in the axon. This causes it to propagate down the neuron.

## Brain Regions
- Each lobe has a specific function and purpose
- Regions
	- Frontal Lobe: controls decision-making, planning, impulse control, reasoning. Includes the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and Broca's area (speech processing)
	- Parietal Lobe: processing sensory information, spatial awareness, navigation.
	- Occipital lobe: visual processing, recognizing shapes, color and movement
	- Temporal Lobe: Auditory processing, memory, language processing, and facial recognition
	- Cerebellum: Voluntary movements, balance, posture 
	- Brain stem: involuntary/autonomic movements, pathway from spinal cord to brain, alertness, sleep
- Other important structures
	- Thalamus: above brain stem, sorts sensory information, contributes to sleep regulation
	- Hypothalamus: homeostasis, hormone regulation/emotional responses
