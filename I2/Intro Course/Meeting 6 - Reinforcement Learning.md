## What is RL
- Study of agents within environments
- Deep RL applies deep learning techniques to these agents

## Terminology
- States 
	- Denoted with respect to time
	- Dictated by environment dynamics
- Actions
	- Taken by the agent after given the current state
	- Impact the next state
- The combination of states and actions results in a reward
- Agent
	- Computer model that interacts with the environment
- Environment
	- The area in which the agent acts
- Reward
	- Indicates how good the agent did
- Trajectory ($\tau$)
	- Sequence of states and actions that end in a certain state
- Return ($R(\tau)$)
	- Reward over a trajectory
- Discounting factor ($\gamma$)
	- Weights future less
