## Synthesis Questions Set 1
1. One component of a neuron is the axon, through which electrical signals are propagated and passed to other neurons. Neurons also consist of dendrites and and synapses, which connect and send signals to other neurons respectively. The cell body of the neuron processes any signals that are received.
2. An action potential travels from the direction of the cell body, along the axon, before reaching the axon terminal.
3. Myelin loss can cause nerve dysfunction, because connections are slowed or obstructed completely.
4. A synapse sends signals to other neurons
5. The core purpose behind a neuron in a neural network and that in the human body is the same: to propagate and interpret signals or values sent in to other neurons. Neural networks differ in the sense that there's less interpretation of signals throughout the overall propagation. For example, the results of neural networks are only interpreted after the inputs have propagated completely through. In the human brain, each neuron firing can correspond to a different biological action or response as a result of the sheer complexity of the human body.

## Synthesis Questions Set 2
1. These different sections are distinguished primarily by two features: their relation to the spinal cord and the consciousness involved in the actions/responses they control. For instance, the hindbrain, which is closer to the spinal cord, typically controls involuntary functions, such as blood pressure regulation or digestion. The forebrain, in contrast, which is further from the spinal cord, controls more complex functions like advanced emotional processing and memory.
2. Parts: Pons and Medulla Oblongata; Functions: handle involuntary actions, such as breathing, digestion, and other fundamentals necessary for life 
3. MRIs and seeing what parts of the brain have blood flowing to them when a person engages in a specific action
4. The four lobes and their functions are:
	1. Frontal Lobe: controls decision-making, planning, impulse control, reasoning. Includes the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and Broca's area (speech processing)
	2. Parietal Lobe: processing sensory information, spatial awareness, navigation.
	3. Occipital lobe: visual processing, recognizing shapes, color and movement
	4. Temporal Lobe: Auditory processing, memory, language processing, and facial recognition

## Synthesis Questions Set 3
1. Four main parts: Frontal, Parietal, Occipital, Temporal
2. Functions of the four main parts of the brain:
	1. Frontal Lobe: controls decision-making, planning, impulse control, reasoning. Includes the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and Broca's area (speech processing)
	2. Parietal Lobe: processing sensory information, spatial awareness, navigation.
	3. Occipital lobe: visual processing, recognizing shapes, color and movement
	4. Temporal Lobe: Auditory processing, memory, language processing, and facial recognition
3. A specific area in which physical stimuli can produce a neurological response
4. Criteria: A region of the cortex different from its neighbors in:
	1. Function
	2. Connectivity to other areas
	3. Distinctive layer structure
	My favorite cortical area is Broca's area, which plays a role in speech processing. I think it's really interesting that we've evolved anatomically to process speech and that we have a dedicated area in our brain for doing so.
