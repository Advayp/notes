- Bridging tech and reality - potential source of inspiration for ideas
- Focus on practical innovation and the product/idea - not necessarily on creating a company
- Retention is key - people don't come back to certain AR products
- Encourage ownership of certain features, better than having a boss and micromanaging
- With AR, focus on creating applicants that supplement reality, not replace it. Think in terms of assistance; the reality should be the main driver of use case and application.
- Don't force the use case - it won't work
- Fully take advantage of the strengths of the platform - use each of the unique features, lean in to wearable AR at a deeper level
