## Why Concurrency
- Code responsiveness
	- Can have one thread perform expensive operations, one update the UI or something
- Processor Utilization
	- Threads make use of the processors effectively
- Failure isolation
- Concurrency is also hard to debug, non-deterministic testing
	- Need to be more disciplined when writing code
