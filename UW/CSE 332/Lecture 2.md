## Asymptotic Analysis
- Evaluate code based on how the runtime and space usage changes based on the size of input
- More mathematical in nature
- Important to consider all inputs too. Want to focus on particularly large inputs.
- Compare algorithms, not code

## Algorithmic Analysis
- Domain: Size of the input to the code 
- Co-domain: Counts of the resources used (number of operations like time, number of bytes of memory, etc.)
- Basic Operations
	- Adding ints/doubles
	- Assignment
	- Return statement
	- Accessing an array index or object field
	- Incrementing a variable
- Can consider different kinds of inputs
	- Worst Case Analysis:  The biggest `f` could be on an input size `N`
	- Best Case Analysis: The smallest `f` could be on an input size `N`
	- Average Case Analysis: What happens on average lol.
- Consider as N gets bigger and bigger
