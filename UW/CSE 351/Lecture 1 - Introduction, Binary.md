- Reference Material
	- Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
	- C Reference Material (online)

## Grades
- Pre-lecture Readings (**required**), 5% of overall grade
- Homework is roughly 20%, unlimited attempts (autograded)
- Labs are roughly 40%, last submission graded (correctness)
	- Work with another person (one submission)
- Midterm and Final are take-home and individual, both are worth 16%
- Participation (~3%)

## To-Do
- Set up CSE linux environment
- Ensure access to Ed
- Read website/syllabus

## Binary and Hex
- Binary is base 2
	- Symbols: 0, 1
	- Convention: Prefix binary numbers with `0b`
- Hexadecimal is base 16
	- Symbols: 0 through 9 and A through F
	- Convention: Prefix with `0x`
- Hex -> Binary
	- Substitute hex digits then drop leading 0s
- Binary -> Hex
	- Pad until groups of 4, and then replace each group with hex representation
- Used because of simple electronic implementations
- Sequences of bits can have various interpretations, so the programmer should decide how to parse those bits
